                                    &quot;I have been a member at IPC for about 2 months now. After doing Chet's cardio class 3 times a week, and recently starting to attend his strength classes also, I have been able to lose close to 15 pounds. I cannot say enough good things about IPC Fitness. The atmosphere they have built at this gym is truly amazing. They have everything you need from basic gym equipment, to cardio machines, to cycling and Pilates equipment.<br /><br />
                                    But what is most special about IPC is the training they offer. These classes are small, group focused classes. I have done 1on1 person training before, and I would pick one of Chet's classes over 1on1 somewhere else any day of the week. While it is a group class, Chet will be on you like a hawk, encouraging you to go harder and faster. The classes alter between cardio focused and strength focused. But Chet somehow seems to slip cardio in both classes. The group acts as a team, cheering and motivating each other on. We have all become close and a little fitness family. When one of us misses a class, the others are on them asking where they were. The culture they have created is definitely unique. <br /><br />
                                    In my opinion, IPC is the best value for a gym in Orlando. No other gym can match the training and amenities IPC offers for the price they offer it at. I joined IPC hoping to be a member only a month or two until I lost my belly. But I do not see myself leaving anytime soon. &quot;

                                    "Chet's workouts were both challenging and effective. He kept things fresh by consistently changing things up so the workouts never became routine or boring. He focused on my goals and created workouts to help me obtain them. Chet was always extremely professional but was still able to keep things fun. His training helped me tremendously in both my professional life as well as my personal life by providing me with more energy and self esteem. It is true when you look better you feel better. When working out with Chet I saw my body fat percentage go down while my muscle tone and energy level went up. I would recommend Chet to anyone looking for a personal trainer. It was definitely money well spent"

I have seen amazing results from his challenging, creative and very effective workout strategies. He is the perfect combination of tough and warm, and he works with the whole person -- mentally, emotionally and physically. Because of his efforts, I am stronger and more flexible, healthier and I have better balance and most importantly, working out has become fun. Being a college-athlete, it has molded me into being a top competitor and has prepared me for life after college. I recommend him without reservation".

                                    Having worked out with Chet off and on over the last 20 years, without a doubt he is a top notch personal trainer. Chet brings professionalism, knowledge, commitment, fun and passion with each workout. I am a wife, a mother of 3 boys & a 6th grade math teacher. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle has always been a priority but gets tough when "life" gets in the way. Thanks to Chet's flexibility and motivation I have been able to work around those "life" obstacles including my limitations. Personalized, not cookie-cutter workouts are key, something Chet ensures. My workouts are tailored to accommodate my leg lymphedema, a side effect of cancer treatments. His knowledge has allowed me to train hard all the while protecting my leg.

                                    Not only has he provided me with excellent workouts but he has also guided me on the right food choices. His food plans have been a huge factor in helping me along my lifelong fitness & health journey.<br /><br />
                                    I highly recommend Chet without any reservations.

                        Since elementary school, physical education (P.E.) has been a passion of mine. I grew up playing a variety of sports such as tennis, soccer, track, football and baseball. 
						That passion lead me to study Exercise Science at Florida State University where I begin to discover the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. 
						After college, I began work in the healthcare industry working for a cardiac device company. While working in the healthcare industry, I saw firsthand how 
						lives are negatively impacted when physical health and fitness are neglected. After a few of years of working in the healthcare industry, I decided to play a different role 
						in life and be a difference maker which lead me to a career in health and fitness. In 2009 I began my journey by becoming a NASM certified personal trainer. 
						Since then I have continued to study and have obtained a variety of other certifications in health and fitness such NASM performance enhancement specialist, 
						NASM senior fitness specialist, EXOS performance specialist certification, Onnit academy foundations certification, Onnit academy Durability certification and 
						Precision Nutrition level 1 certification. Since beginning my journey, I have gained experience working with a variety of individuals ranging from high school 
						athletes looking to improve athletic performance, individuals looking to lose weight, improve fitness level, or build muscle, to elderly individuals looking to 
						function every day at their highest level. My goal every day is to learn and grow as an individual and to seek ways to improve the quality of life of the 
						individuals I work with through health, fitness, and performance.

                        Fitness & Health have always been part of my life.
                        <br /><br />As a teenager, I taught tennis and designed court-based drills to develop sports fitness & racket awareness to school teams and in private lessons.  In college, I went on to major in Professional Tennis Teaching and sports club management.
                        <br /><br />Throughout my life, I have kept up with the working trends of fitness and dietary health.  Articles, seminars and case studies on healthy living have long been the focus of my attention.
                        <br /><br />As a Certified Personal Trainer under the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), I am exposed to the latest in exercise and movement science.  I create custom-tailored programs for non-active individuals and athletes alike.  I am also a certified Weight Loss Specialist and have my own personal experience in losing over 50 lbs.
                        <br /><br />As a Certified Group Fitness Instructor under the American Council on Exercise (ACE), I am able to design various formats for highly effective group training.
                        <br /><br />When I'm not working, I love being outside in the beautiful Florida sun, walking my dog, exploring downtown and other areas throughout metro Orlando.
                        <br /><br />Helping people achieve goals that have forever eluded them and seeing life-changing physical transformations is the reason I want to be YOUR Personal Trainer.

                        also became a personal fitness trainer, and raced in half and full

                        early 2000's, he was swept off his feet by Yoga and has been an

                        In 2006, Russ and Kim opened Studio One Wellness, and Russ received
                        his Florida massage license. He has taught and served in numerous gyms
                        and spas in Central Florida including the Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes

                        Meditation, personally trains guests of all ages, and offers a variety

                        Massage.<br /><br />

                        Afternoons and evenings, Russ does in-home and in-studio massage as
                        well as personal training. He also works at IPC Teaching spin and yoga on Tuesdays.<br /><br />

                        When he's not hanging out with his family or helping others to stay
                        healthy and fit, you can usually find Russ in a kayak paddling up
                        Shingle Creek, the headwaters of the Everglades.<br /><br />
