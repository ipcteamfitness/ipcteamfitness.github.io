                    <p>
                        Although we welcome any fitness commitment, I encourage working as a team. Whether it's individually, with a performance coach, a partner, a group, or a team, everything starts with an individual desire but, ends with a team effort. I know that starting and maintaining any fitness routine can be a challenge. That's why I recommend partnering with others to help reach your goals. When you first arrive at IPC, one of our staff members will greet you, give you a tour of the facility, and discuss your goals. Then, we can offer a strategic plan to help you reach your goals. It's difficult to stick with any routine if you don't first commit to it, second enjoy it, and third have support through it. One of the biggest challenges I hear is "I don't have time". My response: You will never have time for anything, unless you make it. We will work with you to create a fitness regimen that's best for your schedule, enjoyable, and tailored to your specific goals. Our main <strong style="text-decoration:underline;">goal</strong> is to help you achieve yours!
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        To your health!
                    </p>
