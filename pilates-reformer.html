                    This workout combines three fitness disciplines:  ballet, mat Pilates, and yoga body sculpting, to give you the quickest path to core fitness. In combination, these three disciplines quickly slim your waistline, while firming your legs, arms, and glutes.

                <p>
                    This workout delivers overall strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance. These things, in turn, lead to daily life improvements like better posture, graceful, efficient movement, and for many, relief from pain associated with physical imbalances, such as back and hip pain. When we talk about strength building the pilates powerhouse muscles and the muscles of the core are paramount. Flat abs, strong backs, toned glutes and thighs are all results of this discipline.
